# == PlugMod ==
# Here storage and misc settings can be inputted to further configure PlugMod. 
# 
# = DataStore =
# Many plugins use PlugMod for their data storage. This data can get quite extensive.
# Per default, PlugMod saves to sqlite flatfile inside the plugin's map,
# we strongly recommand to instead use either MySQL or Cassandra 
# for better performance and less stress on your server.
# - type - The database type to use, can be either "sqlite", "mysql" or "cassandra".
# 
# > Remote
# Settings for either MySQL or Cassandra that tell where the data is.
# - host - The ip or hostname of the remote database (use 127.0.0.1 for local db)
# - port - The port of the database (MySQL default = 3306, Cassandra default = 9042)
# - database - The name of the database to use.
# - username - Username for plugmod to connect with, leave blank for no authentication.
# - password - Password to use. Leave blank for no password.
